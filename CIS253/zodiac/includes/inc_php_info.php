<p>One of the most important things a back end language needs to do is be fast and secure.  If you use the new versions then it is faster and more secure than the previous version.  Because of its wide use there are many things that help fix weaknesses against cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Many new languages can be unstable as they are working out the kinks.  PHP has been around for a long time.  Any problems it has found in the past have been patched and many frameworks and tools have been added over this time as well.  PHP has grown and hasn't stopped growing which is why it can compete with many newer languages.</p>

<p>Along with the maturity PHP has on its competitors, the veteran community helps a great deal with any issues a programmer may have.  There are many tutorials, tips and FaQ forums posted to help many issues someone might find.</p>

<p>PHP has lots of great things in regards to the functionality of the language.  I love coding PHP even more so than I enjoy writing about it.  You can have functions, variables, strings, arrays, and lots of great integration with xhtml.</p>
